# Summary
MyHaikus is a platform that allows users to explore a diverse collection of renowned authors and their haikus. It offers a user-friendly environment for effortlessly managing personal haikus and viewing those created by others, enabling users to appreciate the beauty of this unique form of poetry. Users can create, update, delete, and share haikus with ease, all facilitated through the front-end using Angular and TypeScript.

Haiku.API serves as a robust RESTful API designed for creating and managing haikus and haiku creators. It features JWT Authorization for secure access (utilizing cookies to store the tokens), CRUD operations with built-in validation (including a custom syllable counter), and Serilog for efficient log tracking and monitoring, all implemented through the back-end using .NET.

For documentation, DocFX is utilized to generate comprehensive back-end documentation, ensuring developers have clear and accessible resources. On the front-end, Compodoc is employed for JSDoc documentation, providing detailed insights into the Angular application structure and components. This dual documentation approach enhances maintainability and understanding across the project.

The project also includes unit tests for services using XUnit to ensure reliability and performance in the back-end, as well as Karma for unit testing in the front-end.
